        <h1>Jaguar</h1>
        <p>The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a wild cat species and the only extant member of the genus Panthera native to the Americas.</p>
        <p>The jaguar's present range extends from Southwestern United States and Mexico across much of Central America and south to Paraguay and northern Argentina.</p>
        <p>Though there are single cats now living within the western United States, the species has largely been extirpated from the United States since the early 20th century.</p>
        <p>It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List; and its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and fragmentation of habitat.</p>
